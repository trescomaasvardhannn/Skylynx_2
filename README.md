Flight Booking Website

This project is a comprehensive flight booking website developed as part of a software engineering project. The platform allows users to search, book, and manage flight reservations with features including flight sorting, filtering, and recommendations. Users can customize their bookings by adding services such as extra baggage, meal preferences, and seat selection.
